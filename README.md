# **JWT Test Project** ðŸ”‘

This project is a **JWT (JSON Web Token)** testing application, developed using **FastAPI**, **Uvicorn**, and **SQLAlchemy**. The goal of this project is to provide a simple demonstration of how to use JWTs for authentication in FastAPI, including token creation, validation, and storing login timestamps in a MySQL database for each user who logs in.

## **Features** âœ¨

- **JWT Authentication**: Users can log in using their credentials, and the server will generate a JWT token that can be used to authenticate further requests.

- **Token Expiry**: Tokens are time-limited and automatically expire after a set period, providing an additional layer of security.

- **Login Timestamps**: When a user logs in, their JWT token creation time (login time) is stored in the database to track their session history.

- **SQLAlchemy Integration**: Utilizes **SQLAlchemy** to interact with the MySQL database, allowing users' login timestamps and related data to be efficiently stored and retrieved.

- **FastAPI Backend**: FastAPI powers the backend, providing high-performance and type-safe routes for generating and validating JWT tokens.

- **Uvicorn Server**: The application runs on **Uvicorn**, an ASGI server for handling asynchronous requests with high throughput.
